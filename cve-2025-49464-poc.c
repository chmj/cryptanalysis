#
# Vulnerability Details:
# A buffer overflow vulnerability in certain Zoom Clients for Windows may allow an
# authorized user to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via network access.
#
# Affected Versions (as per the report):
# - Zoom Workplace for Windows before version 6.4.0
# - Zoom Workplace VDI for Windows before version 6.3.10 (except 6.1.7 and 6.2.15)
# - Zoom Rooms for Windows before version 6.4.0
# - Zoom Rooms Controller for Windows before version 6.4.0
# - Zoom Meeting SDK for Windows before version 6.4.0
